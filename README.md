# JokesAPI
A custom API that demonstrates RESTful architecture. It leverages Node.js and Express.js to create the server. 

To find the API Documentation, go to https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/6048123/2s9XxsTv8Y#79b97759-642c-46e5-bc16-d8871fdd1d5d

To use this API yourself:
1. Initialize npm and use it to install the dependencies
2. Launch the index.js server on your local machine
3. Interact with it as you like! Personally, I use Postman to try out the POST requests.
