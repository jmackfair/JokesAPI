# JokesAPI
A custom API that demonstrates RESTful architecture.

It leverages Node.js and Express.js to create the server. 

To use this API yourself:
1. Initialize npm and use it to install the dependencies
2. Launch the index.js server on your local machine
3. Interact with it as you like! Personally, I use Postman to try out the POST requests.
